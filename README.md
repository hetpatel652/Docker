# Docker notes

🪞Docker Image
A Docker image is like a blueprint — it has everything your app needs: Code, Libraries, Dependencies ,OS setup

📦 Docker Container
A Docker container is a running instance of an image — like launching the blueprint.
You can run many containers from the same image.

🔁 Analogy:
Image = recipe 📖
Container = dish 🍽️ made from the recipe
